# Before Push Quality Checks

Run the project's quality gate before pushing.

## Command

```bash
pnpm b4push
```

## What It Checks

1. **Type checking** — `pnpm check` (astro sync + tsc --noEmit)
2. **Build** — `pnpm build` (full Astro production build)
3. **Link check** — `pnpm run check:links` (scan dist/ for broken internal links)

## When to Run

- Before pushing to remote
- After adding or moving documentation articles
- After modifying internal links between articles

## Link Check Details

The link checker (`scripts/check-links.js --strict`) scans built HTML in `dist/` for:
- Broken internal links (href pointing to non-existent pages)
- Absolute links in MDX source that bypass the base path (`/pj/zcss/`)

Runs in strict mode — exits with error on any broken link.
